Hint
An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1690


ans::

class Solution {
    public int nthUglyNumber(int n) {

         int[] uglyNumbers = new int[n];
        uglyNumbers[0] = 1;

        int i2 = 0, i3 = 0, i5 = 0;
        int nextMultipleOf2 = 2;
        int nextMultipleOf3 = 3;
        int nextMultipleOf5 = 5;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int nextUglyNumber = Math.min(nextMultipleOf2, Math.min(nextMultipleOf3, nextMultipleOf5));
            uglyNumbers[i] = nextUglyNumber;

            if (nextUglyNumber == nextMultipleOf2) {
                i2++;
                nextMultipleOf2 = uglyNumbers[i2] * 2;
            }
            if (nextUglyNumber == nextMultipleOf3) {
                i3++;
                nextMultipleOf3 = uglyNumbers[i3] * 3;
            }
            if (nextUglyNumber == nextMultipleOf5) {
                i5++;
                nextMultipleOf5 = uglyNumbers[i5] * 5;
            }
        }

        return uglyNumbers[n - 1];
        
    }
}

You said:
There is only one character 'A' on the screen of a notepad. You can perform one of two operations on this notepad for each step:

Copy All: You can copy all the characters present on the screen (a partial copy is not allowed).
Paste: You can paste the characters which are copied last time.
Given an integer n, return the minimum number of operations to get the character 'A' exactly n times on the screen.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Initially, we have one character 'A'.
In step 1, we use Copy All operation.
In step 2, we use Paste operation to get 'AA'.
In step 3, we use Paste operation to get 'AAA'.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: 0.

public class MinSteps {
    public int minSteps(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return 0;

        int steps = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            while (n % i == 0) {
                steps += i;
                n /= i;
            }
        }
        return steps;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinSteps solution = new MinSteps();
        System.out.println(solution.minSteps(3)); // Output: 3
        System.out.println(solution.minSteps(1)); // Output: 0
    }
